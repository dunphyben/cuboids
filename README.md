* 3-d rectangular objects in space - rectangular cuboids
* Cuboids should have an origin (x, y, z)
* Create (initialize) an object at a specific origin, with specified l,w,h
* Should be able to move object to different origin
* Get a list of vertices that represent the cuboid (8 total)
* Test whether or not 2 cuboids are overlapping
* Objects should be able to rotate: inside a bin
* Bin constricts rotation of the cuboid if cuboid is up against its wall
* Cuboids can only exist inside the walls of the bin
