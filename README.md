 3-d rectangular objects (cubes) in finite space (3d grid)
 	x,y,z

 should be able to:
	initialize an object at a certain origin with certain l, w, and h
	move your object to different origin
	get a list of the vertices that represent the cuboid (8 total vertices)

	write a method that tests whether or not 2 cuboid are overlapping

	Bonus: allow objects to rotate at 90 degree angles
